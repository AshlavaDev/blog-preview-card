## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variable
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Prettier

### What I learned

I learned, or rather relearned, how font sizes can be made responsive to the screen size without the use of media queries. While I am used to using libraries such as Tailwind which has responsiveness to its design, I rarely use non-media query solutions to basic CSS/SASS.

### Useful resources
